## [1.0.1] - 2015-07-15
### Changed
- Changed default options so that on initial install, incoming links won't be sent to the main window.

## [1.0.0] - 2015-07-15
- First version of *Epichrome Helper*, a companion Chrome extension that handles link redirection so each app can have rules for which links it handles itself and which should be sent to the default browser. (Thanks to [treyharris](https://github.com/treyharris "treyharris") for first bringing up the idea, and to [phillip-r](https://github.com/phillip-r "phillip-r") and [cbeams](https://github.com/cbeams "cbeams") for more thoughts on how it might work.)
